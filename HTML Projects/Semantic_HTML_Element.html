                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>A typical tailor shop would have a master, a foreman, several journeymen, and apprentices. The apprentices,
                    often beginning their training as young adolescents and indentured to the master by their parents (for
                    a fee), performed menial tasks such as cleaning, managing the fires to heat the pressing-irons, running
                    errands, and matching fabric and trims. Apprentices were also taught the
                    <mark>"tailor's posture"</mark>, to sit cross-legged on a raised board or bench while they sewed. A tailoring
                    establishment then generally consisted of a well-appointed room in which the master would measure customers.
                    Cutting, sewing, buttonholes, and finishing work were performed in adjoining rooms.

                        <p>Indian cut, British cut, Italian cut, American cut - Just as there are various methods of tailoring,
                            there are also styles that differ regionally. This is due to different climates and cultures
                            in the world, causing "house style" cuts of the trade.
