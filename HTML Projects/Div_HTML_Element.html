                    <strong>Discover true personalization. Individual of your style.</strong> Fashion design is the art of applying
                    design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories. It is influenced
                    by culture and different trends, and has varied over time and place. "A fashion designer creates clothing,
                    including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers.
                    He or she can specialize in clothing, accessory, or jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these
                    areas."

                <p>
                    <em>Discover true quality. True quality and Elegance.</em> Fashion designers work in a variety of different
                    ways when designing their pieces and accessories such as rings, bracelets, necklaces and earrings. Due
                    to the time required to put a garment out in market, designers must anticipate changes to consumer desires.
                    Fashion designers are responsible for creating looks for individual garments, involving shape, color,
                    fabric, trimming, and more.

                <p>Clothes that needs to be sewing. Perfectly tailored clothing. Fashion designers attempt to design clothes
                    that are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment
                    and the situations in which it will be worn, and they work within a wide range of materials, colors,
                    patterns, and styles. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional
                    styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as evening wear or party dresses.
